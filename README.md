This program takes the derivative of a function.
Right now it only supports the derivative of a single polynomial term.
Updates will continue to come to support more complicated functions: i.e. trig functions, exponential functions, etc.
I have plans to make this a full blown derivative calculator, which is able to take derivatives of functions that are long and complicated
